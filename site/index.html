			Links pretty much what makes the web what it is. In this lecture, we're going to take a look at different types of links and how you could create them in your HTML page. So the first type of links that we're going to take a look at are internal links. Here I am looking at the file called links-internal.html, and it's located in the examples/Lecture09 folder. And here we have a couple of links we're going to take a look at. Now the way you create links is by specifying an a element with an attribute href. And href stands for hypertext reference. The value of href can either be a relative or an absolute URL. In our case here, since we're discussing internal links which are links that point to internal web pages of the where application, the links we're showing are all relative URL links.
