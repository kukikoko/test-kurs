                            I have been passionate about the computer games since the age of 10, starting with my first Commodore 116 then Atari 800XL and later PCs and I have carried through with this passion until adulthood. <br>Over the years it allowed me to absorb the different intricacies introduced in the various, highly marketed game brands and their products.  
                            <br>Until now I have been working in business travel industry and it gave me the ability to work under the time pressure and expanded my concentration, perceptivity and accuracy skills as well as my teamwork attitude.  
                            <br>As a person who like new challenges, I would like to change my hobby into the career and get into the computer industry and reach the level of experience expected to test potentially popular games before market release. 
                            <br>Aside from my good communication skills, perfect knowledge of my native language, fluency in English both written and spoken and ability to work with the team, I am very particular to the details that make the game playable and coherent.  
                            <br>I have also finished the HTML, CSS and javascript course and I learned angular myself.
                            <br>Please check the "Interests" part of this site and find the partial list of the games that inspired me the most or simply gave me a lot of fun. 
                            <br>I believe I would be a valuable addition to your testing team. 
                            <br>Looking forward to hearing from you.
